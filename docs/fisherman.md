Fisherman is a small git hook management tool for developer. This tool was conceived as a simple and customizable tool to control commits.

All existing analogs are not suitable for me for several reasons:
- They have dependencies: `node.js`, `ruby`, `python`.
- They support few hooks.
- They have a complex configuration or do not have it.
- Does not contain basic and common checks rules.
- Require to store files in a git repository.
