## Common `variables` and `extract-variables` sections

Each hook configuration section contains `variables` and `extract-variables` subsection.
These sections used for define user variables.

```yaml
variables:
  VariableName1: 'variable-value'
extract-variables:
  - Extract(BranchName, '^(?P<VariableName2>demo1)$')
  - Extract(BranchName, '^(?P<VariableName3>demo2)$')
```

### extract-variables

`extract-variables` section extracts variables from the name of the current
branch using named groups in regular expressions.

:::info
Remember fisherman is written in the [go programming language](https://golang.org)
and you should use golang notation for named grouped: `(?P<name>regex)`. You can
get more information on the [official website of the package regexp](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/).
You can also test your regular expressions on service [Rego](https://regoio.herokuapp.com/)
or [regex101](https://regex101.com/) (note: select flavor golang).
:::

For example: for branch `refs/heads/N1-do-something` and
regexp `^refs\/heads\/(?P<Number>N\d+)-(?P<Description>.*)$` for all templates
in section `commit-msg` will be defined variables `Number` with value `N1`
and `Description` with value `do-something`.
