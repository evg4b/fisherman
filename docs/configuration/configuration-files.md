Fisherman supports very flexible configuration. All its configuration is
contained in `.fisherman.yml` file.

## Configuration file inheritance

Fisherman supports inheritance of configuration files with different visibility levels.
At the moment, there are 3 places where fisherman is looking for configuration files.

- **Global configuration for user (Global config)** - Global configuration for
  the user. This config file is located in the user directory (`~/.fisherman.yml`
  for linux and `%USERPROFILE%/.fisherman.yml` for windows). The settings specified
  in this file will apply to which repository in which fisherman was initialized.
  The configuration has the lowest priority. All rules will be overridden in other
  configuration files.

- **Repository configuration (Repo config)** - This configuration is located directly
  in the repository and can be shared with your team. The rules from this file will
  overwrite the rules from the global configuration.

- **Local configuration for repository** - This configuration is located in `.git`
  directory in your repository. Rules in this file have the highest priority and
  well override all other rules. This was done primarily to add your own rules without
  changing repository configuration file or without configuring files in the repository.

The loaded configuration files and the path to them you can find in the header of
hook handler.
