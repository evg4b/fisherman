This rules sets shell scripts for validation (All scripts are executed in parallel
at the moment the hook is triggered).

Shell script can be configured using the following structure:

``` yaml
- type: commit-suffix
  env:
    var1: value1
    var2: value2
  commands:
    - command1
    - command2
  encoding: cp866
  output: true
```

You can create as many scripts to validation. Scripts will be executed on the
[shell for your system](#shell-for-system).

- **commands** - Array of strings with validation script commands. Is also supports
  tempesting based on hook variables.
- **when** - An expression on C like language. It allows you to define a condition
  for executing a script. See more in section [Condition expressions](../expressions.md).
- **env** - Sets additional environment variables (system environment variables
  also will be included)  for the command.
- **output** - Indicates whether to print the command output. By default false.
  To display parallel output, use a prefix with script name before each output line.
- **encoding** - Setup shell output encoding (UTF-8) by default.

Example:

``` text
script1 | validation data set 1...
script2 | Process started
script1 | validation data set 2...
script1 | validation data set 3...
script2 | Warning something went wrong
script1 | validation data set 3...
```

## Simple configuration

Also, when script does not require additional configuration (output and env variables),
it can be set with the following code:

```yaml
single-line: 'command2 arg1'
single-line-array: ['command1', 'command2']
multilane-array:
  - 'command1 arg1 arg2'
  - 'command2 arg1'
```

## System related script

<!-- TODO: update this section -->

In the case when it is not possible to specify a universal script for all systems,
you can specify separated scripts for each system.

:::caution Note
Be sure to specify scripts for each system, otherwise the hook will be skipped for
the system without configuration
:::

```yaml
shell:
  windows:
    windows-script1: # ... script definition
    windows-script1: # ... script definition
  linux:
    linux-script1: # ... script definition
    linux-script2: # ... script definition
  darwin:
    darwin-script1: # ... script definition
```

## Shell for system

Currently, only the following system shells are supported (They can be globally
with field `default-shell` or with field `shell` fore each script directly):

- **Linux** - `bash`
- **Mac OS** - `bash`
- **Windows** - `powershell`

:::caution Note on windows
<!-- TODO: update this caution -->
Powershell by default do not return non zero exit code on fail. [See more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_preference_variables?view=powershell-7#erroractionpreference).
