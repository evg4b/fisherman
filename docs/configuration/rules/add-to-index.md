The rule is used to automatically add files to the index after rules or previous
scripts. This rule can be used for adding auto-generated files (mocks, styles,
and others) in the index.

## Syntax

``` yaml
- type: add-to-index
  globs:
    - glob: ~/project/*.go
      required: true
    - glob: ~/mocks/*.go
      required: false
    - glob: ~/assets/*.css
    - glob: ~/assets/*.js
```

- **globs** - List of files that will be added to the git index, before commit
  but after when all validations rules finished. These files always will be
  added to the git index.
- **required** - This flag marks this action as required or not. When glob is
  masked as required and where there are no files matched to it, commit will be rejected.

You can also use a short syntax (in this case required will be false):

``` yaml
- type: add-to-index
  globs: [ 'mocks/**/*', 'go.sum', 'go.mod' ]
```
