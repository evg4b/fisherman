This rule runs program with passe arguments for validation. When program returns
exit code different from zero then action will be canceled.

:::caution Note
`exec` rule can runs only executable files in your system. In this one you can
not use commands from shell e.p. `cp`, `rm`, `mkdir` and others. For more details,
see the information on [the link](../../faq#difference-between-exec-and-shell-script).

      args: [arg1, arg2]
      env:
        VAR1: new value
      dir: program-directory
