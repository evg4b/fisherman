# Git Hooks Reference

Fisherman supports all standard Git hooks. This reference explains when each hook is triggered, what arguments it
receives, and common use cases.

## Overview

Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commits, pushes, and merges. Fisherman intercepts
these hooks and executes configured rules based on your `.fisherman.toml` configuration.

---

## Client-Side Hooks

Client-side hooks are triggered by local operations like committing and merging.

### `pre-commit`

**Triggered:** Before a commit is created (after staging files but before entering the commit message)

**Can abort:** Yes (exit code 1 prevents commit)

**Arguments:** None

**Common use cases:**

- Run tests
- Check code formatting
- Run linters
- Validate file contents
- Check for debugging statements or TODO comments
- Ensure no large files are being committed

**Example configuration:**

```toml
[[hooks.pre-commit]]
type = "exec"
command = "cargo"
args = ["test"]

[[hooks.pre-commit]]
type = "exec"
command = "cargo"
args = ["fmt", "--check"]

[[hooks.pre-commit]]
type = "exec"
command = "cargo"
args = ["clippy", "--", "-D", "warnings"]
```

**When to use:** For validations that should happen before every commit.

---

### `prepare-commit-msg`

**Triggered:** After the default commit message is generated but before the editor is opened

**Can abort:** Yes

**Arguments:**

1. Path to commit message file
2. Source of commit message (`message`, `template`, `merge`, `squash`, or `commit`)
3. Commit SHA (only for `commit` source)

**Common use cases:**

- Modify commit message template
- Add issue numbers or tags automatically
- Include branch information in commit message
- Insert commit message guidelines

**Example configuration:**

```toml
extract = ["branch?:^(?<IssueNumber>PROJ-\\d+)-.*$"]

[[hooks.prepare-commit-msg]]
type = "write-file"
when = "is_def_var(\"IssueNumber\")"
path = ".git/COMMIT_EDITMSG"
content = "{{IssueNumber}}: "
append = true
```

**When to use:** To prepare or modify the commit message before the user edits it.

---

### `commit-msg`

## Best Practices

1. **Keep hooks fast** - Slow hooks interrupt developer workflow
2. **Use appropriate hooks** - Match actions to the right hook lifecycle
3. **Provide clear error messages** - Help developers understand failures
4. **Test hooks thoroughly** - Use `fisherman handle <hook>` to test
5. **Document hook behavior** - Explain what each hook does in your configuration
6. **Use client-side hooks for validation** - Server-side hooks for enforcement
7. **Make hooks skippable for emergencies** - Use `git commit --no-verify` when necessary
8. **Don't run expensive operations in every hook** - Use conditional execution
